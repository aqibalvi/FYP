# FYP
Final Year Project [Android-Python-Firebase]: An Android application that recommend events relevant to the userâ€™s personality and predict the success/failure of any organizing event, through sentiment analysis. Recommendations and analysis was on back-end Python using Firebase to maintain data.

For recommending events to the user we used collaborative and content based filtering to cater the cold start and also the user activity based recommendations. We have used supervised learning model SVM (Support Vector Machine) to categorize the users on the basis of their good rated events description and their frequent visiting event category.
